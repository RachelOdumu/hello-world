# hello-world

Aloha world,

My name is Rachel Odumu. I am a student-athlete @ the University of Hawaii @ Manoa. I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering and a minor in Spanish while living the dream and playing Division 1 basketball. I am super interested in the Internet of Things (IoT), home automation, ios apps, java, html, and overall design of software. Coding algorithims tend to confuse me...
